You need MinGW with Msys, CMake and Yasm. All in the PATH too.

Build ffmpeg/Libav:
1. Download ffmpeg from https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html or Libav from https://libav.org/download
2. Put it in an ffmpeg directory
3. Run build_ffmpeg.sh under sh.exe

Build x265 dll:
1. Download x265 library from https://github.com/videolan/x265 (download as zip)
2. Extract it in x265-master directory (the downloaded git zip contains this directory)
3. Run sh.exe in x265-master\build\msys directory 
4. Run ./make-Makefiles.sh
5. On CMake GUI: disable ENABLE_CLI, enable ENABLE_SHARED, STATIC_LINK_CRT, WINXP_SUPPORT, modify CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to x265-master/build/msys
6. Press Configure, then Generate
7. Exit from the CMake GUI
8. Run (mingw) make command to create libx265.dll and libx265.dll.a

Build x265vfw dll and installer for the both dll:
1. Extract the x265vfw src (you should get/use x265-master and x265vfw directories parallel)
2. Run sh.exe in the x265vfw directory
3. Run ./configure
4. Run (mingw) make to create bin/x265vfw.exe installer, which contains the x265vfw.dll and libx265.dll too

Notes:
- if you have all requred packages/dirs (ffmpeg, x265-master, x265vfw) in one directory, you can run build_all_x86.sh or build_all_x64.sh too (depending on your MinGW version)
- (mingw) make can run in a normal cmd shell too (just in the proper directory)
- not recommended to use -j option at make
